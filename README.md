This is my first front end development project for <Code Louisville>.  I am using this project as an opportunity to put in to practice the skills I have attained through the 12 week program.

My goal is to rewrite the html/css for kilesigns.com from scratch and make it responsive.  Currently the site consists of all images, including the text portion.  Additional features I will be including are; adding click-to-call links to their business number, adding click-to-email links to their email address, adding linked social media icons above the nav bar, adding google maps integration on their contact us page, and adding a contact form to the contact us page.
